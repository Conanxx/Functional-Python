# Collection of Python constructs to facilitate functional programming

* Ideas:
  
** Implement functional constructs using Python language.
   
** Study how functional ideas can fit in with normal business domain.
   
** Alternative approaches to OOP constructs.



* TODO:

** DONE Initialize a git repo.  
  
** Implement functional constructs:
   
*** Function composition: Pipeline, Monad, ...

*** Function builder:
    Abstract away loop mechanism
    Expose continuation to introdues a high level API.

*** Polymorphism:
    Multimethod

** Apply functional constructs in various business domains

** Differences between OOP and FP, and alternative approaches.

*** Partial application as abstractions.   


* Requirements:   

** Python 3 should suffice since we try to implements most features from scratch

** Jupyter Notebook is current main editor to experiment all the code.
